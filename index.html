				## Outline 
				* The last 2 years ...
					* Political interventions
					* ACCC recommendations
					* AEMO interventions
				* The NEG
					* The good, the bad and the ugly
					* More political interventions
				* Future of the NEM
					* Will the energy-only market survive?
				</section>

				<h3> The National Electricity Market </h3>
				<h4> a socio-technical system </h4>
				  <blockquote>
					"In Australia, the National Electricity Market is a ‘synthetic market’. It did not arise naturally, but was deliberately created by Australian governments using the tools of microeconomics. Every time you turn on a light switch, you are participating in a market designed and run by microeconomists."
				  </blockquote>
				<b>-Stephen King, August 2010 </b>

				<section data-markdown>
				### Political interventions: Act I
				* State renewable energy targets
					* ACT Reverse Auction Scheme
					* Victorian Renewable Energy Target (VRET)
					* Victorian Renewable Energy Target (QRET)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### Political interventions: Act II
				* South Australian Power Plan
					* Hornsdale Power Reserve
					* 'Temporary' State-owned generators
					* Emergency Powers to the State Minister
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### Political interventions: Act III
				* "Nation building"
					* Tasmania as "Battery of the Nation"
					* "Snowy 2.0"
						* Commonwealth aquires Snowy 1.0
						* Commonwealth now the 4th largest gentailer! 
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### ACCC: "Recomendation 4"
				The Australian Government should operate a program under which it will enter into low fixed-price
				(for example, $45–50/MWh) energy offtake agreements for the later years (say 6–15) of appropriate
				new generation projects which meet certain criteria
				
				</section>

				<section>
				<section><h3>ACCC "Recomendation 4" </h3>
				<ul>
				<li> Have at least three customers who have committed to acquire energy from the project for at least the first five years of operation</li>
				<li> Not involve any existing retail or wholesale market participant with a significant market share.</li>
				<li> Be capable of providing a firm product so that it can meet the needs of C&I customers.</li>
				</ul></section>

				<h3> Political interventions: Act IV? </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>"Baseload underwriting"</li>
				
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking forward to <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ScottMorrisonMP</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/AngusTaylorMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AngusTaylorMP</a> getting baseload underwriting scheme underway ASAP to develop new coal-fired power stations, inc one in Nth Qld. More is needed: major equity fund for new coal-fired power &amp; abandon costly green treaties, mandates &amp; subsidies.</p>&mdash; George Christensen (@GChristensenMP) <a href="https://twitter.com/GChristensenMP/status/1033635119376949248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">26 August 2018</a></blockquote>

					<li> Scope for further political interference </li>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### Political interventions: Act IV? 
				* "Default market offer" for electricity prices?
					* (Constitionally challenging)				
				* Return to regulated energy pricing moves a step closer?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### Re-Centralisation & Re-Regulation?
				* State action dominating decision making and resource allocation 
				* Much more 'command and control' than 'market led'
					* ACCC recomendation bit more market led 
					* Still scope for political interference
				</section>
				
								<section data-markdown>
				<h3> AEMO and Reliability </h3>
				<img src="pics/1in3.png"  height="100%" width="100%">  </li>

				<section data-markdown>
				## AEMO and the RERT
				* Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT)
					* $52 million in total
					* Mostly paid for by Victorians
					* One event was $24 million for 390 MWh (...$62,000/MWh)

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## AEMO and the RERT
				* Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT)
					* Market wasn't at VoLL						
					* Why wasn't the market at VoLL??
						* ... Was it actually needed?

				# Getting NEG'ed
				</section>

				<section>
				  	<h2>The good (?)</h2>
				  <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
					"In general, the NEG is a stupendously complicated idea that isn't really designed to achieve anything - other than political agreement"
				  </blockquote>
				<b>-Alan Kohler, August 2018 </b>

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## The bad
				* Process has been pretty ordinary 
				* The ESB is supposed to report to the COAG EC
					* (You would be forgiven for thinking otherwise)
					* No QRET or VRET modelled
				* Not particularly broad consultation 
				* Stark contrasts with other similar excercises
				* The modelling (...it's very bad)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## And the ugly ...
				### More interventions!

				* Reliability obligation
					* "the ESB will consult on two additional options: the inclusion of an additional trigger at T-5, and the removal of the T-3 trigger"					
					* "proposed ability for a jurisdiction to trigger the reliability obligation as a transitional arrangement" (!!!)
				* Might (?) still go ahead
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### What does this mean for the NEM?
				#### What does it mean for energy-only markets?

				* The market has (arguably) been usurped:
					* Has it ever really workrd to incentivise new capacity?
				* Perhaps political and institutional interventions have not _allowed_ it to work
					* The political cost might be too high to do so
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				### What does this mean for the NEM?
				#### What does it mean for energy-only markets?

				* This is not to say energy-only are "good" or "bad":
					* But questions need to be asked about if it is working
					* And if it _can_ work
					* And if not, to be consciously aware of this!
