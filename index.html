					## National Electricity Market:
					### Tail between its NEG?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## Outline 
				* The last 2 years ...
					* Political interventions
					* ACCC recommendations
					* AEMO interventions
				* The NEG
					* The good, the bad and the ugly
					* More political interventions
				* Future of the NEM
					* Will the energy-only market survive?
				* (OpenNEM)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## Political interventions
				* South Australian Power Plan
					* Hornsdale Power Reserve
					* 'Temporary' State-owned generators
					* Emergency Powers to the State Minister
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## Political interventions 
				* State renewable energy targets
					* Victorian Renewable Energy Target (VRET)
					* Victorian Renewable Energy Target (QRET)
					* ACT Reverse Auction Scheme*					
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## Political interventions 
				* "Nation building"
					* Tasmania as "Battery of the Nation"
					* "Snowy 2.0"
						* Commonwealth aquires Snowy 1.0
						* Commonwealth now the 4th largest gentailer! 
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## ACCC interventions
				### "Recomendation 4"
				The Australian Government should operate a program under which it will enter into low fixed-price
				(for example, $45–50/MWh) energy offtake agreements for the later years (say 6–15) of appropriate
				new generation projects which meet certain criteria
				
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				* have at least three customers who have committed to acquire energy from the project for at
				least the first five years of operation
				* not involve any existing retail or wholesale market participant with a significant market share (say
				* a share of 10 per cent or more in any NEM region)
				* be of sufficient capacity to serve the needs of a number of large customers
				* be capable of providing a firm product so that it can meet the needs of C&I customers.
				
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## Re-Centralisation?
				* State action dominating decision making and resource allocation 
				* Much more 'command and control' than 'market led'
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## AEMO interventions
				* Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT)
					* $52 million in total
					* Mostly paid for by Victorians
					* One event was $24 million for 390 MWh (...$62,000/MWh)

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## AEMO interventions
				* Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT)
					* The flipside...
						* Market wasn't at VoLL
						* Half an hour at VoLL in Vic would have cost $62 million
					* Why wasn't the market at VoLL??
						* Represents a wealth transfer from generators to consumers
						* ...Who's going to build new capacity??

				# Getting NEG'ed
				</section>

				<section>
				  	<h2>The good (?)</h2>
				  <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
					"In general, the NEG is a stupendously complicated idea that isn't really designed to achieve anything - other than political agreement"
				  </blockquote>

				<section data-markdown>
				## The bad
				### (it's very bad)

				* The modelling
					* Contracting
					* Demand response 				  
					* Missing money
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
				## And the ugly ...

				* Process has been truly awful
				* The ESB is supposed to report to the COAG EC
					* (You would be forgiven for thinking otherwise)
					* No QRET or VRET modelled
				* Not particularly broad consultation 
					* Confidentially agreements required for those that were involved.
				* Stark contrasts with other similar excercises
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
				## And the ugly ...
				### More interventions!

				* "the ESB will consult on two additional options: the inclusion of an additional trigger at T-5, and the removal of the T-3 trigger"
				* "proposed ability for a jurisdiction to trigger the reliability obligation as a transitional arrangement" (!!!)
				  
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## What does this mean for the NEM?
				### What does it mean for energy-only markets?

				* The market has (arguably) been usurped:
					* Has it actually every work to incentivise new capacity?
				* Political and institutional interventions have not _allowed_ it to work
					* The political cost might be too high to do so
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				## What does this mean for the NEM?
				### What does it mean for energy-only markets?

				* This is not to say energy-only are "good" or "bad":
					* But questions need to be asked about if it is working
					* And if it _can_ work
					* And if not, to be consciously aware of this!
